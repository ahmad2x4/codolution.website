                    <p class="lead">Introduction</p>
                    <p>Relay ME is a free Android app that forwards your texts to an email address you provide. It uses a GMail account that you control to send your texts as emails. Your main email inbox, where your texts go, can be anywhere. In order to use this app, you are going to need a GMail account, Internet connectivity, and a browser on your phone. It is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinywebgears.relayme">Google Play Store</a>. If you can't access Play Store please contact us so that we can work out an alternative.</p>
                    <p>Please check <a href="https://bitbucket.org/codolutions/relay-me/wiki">the project wiki</a> for more information, frequently asked questions, and common issues.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Privacy Policy</p>
                    <p>Relay ME needs to know the email address used to send out emails, also the target email address if they are different. It also keeps details of recent text messages in order to display in the log and retry should an error occur. All information mentioned here is kept locally in the app and can be deleted at any time by clearing application data.</p>
                    <p>It is highly recommended to use a separate email account for the gateway, since you probably don't want an application have access to your main email account. This isn't what we want either, and that's why this app works differently than similar products. We encourage you to care about your privacy.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Disclaimer</p>
